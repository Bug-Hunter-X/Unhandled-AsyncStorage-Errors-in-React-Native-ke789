# Unhandled AsyncStorage Errors in React Native

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications involving the improper handling of asynchronous operations with AsyncStorage.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version with comprehensive error handling.

The original code lacks error handling, leading to potential crashes if AsyncStorage operations fail. The improved version uses `try...catch` blocks to gracefully handle errors and prevent app crashes. This ensures a more robust and reliable user experience.
